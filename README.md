Calculation of Frequency in the Helical Compression Springs
# Abstract
In the present industrial era, the major structural components are often made of rigid and massive elements. Those mechanisms are so fluctuated by wobbling of structures and vibrating of the material can decline the effectiveness of that mechanism. As a result, service life of that product gradually reduces. So, to minimize the influences of result from external irregular vibration from various machine elements, can be reduced by using various technical methods for absorbing vibration. For example, vibration isolation table which use air damper and heavy granite surface plate are used. From this Research paper, we can conclude that vibrations in the spring can be reduced by varying the different parameters of the spring used in the machines.
# Introduction
These days, industry of mobile phone, semiconductor and display have been developedrapidly. These industries need micro- and nano-scale components. High accuracy and fine repeatability must be satisfied for their manufacturing. But it is difficult to achieve the high accuracy and repeatability, because of irregular vibration is detrimental to the precision. Generally, the causes of the vibration are various which increases vibration, noise, vibration caused by machine operation, decrease efficiency of the machine, etc and this can be reduced by using the springs in the mechanisms.
# Conclusion
By using the Python program and Ansys analysis, we determined the amount of deflection and Frequency of the spring at various conditions like diameter of the spring, number of coils in the spring, Weight (or) load acting on the spring. And noticed that the Deflection of the spring is gradually decreasing with increase of the diameter of the Wire.
